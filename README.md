# Pac-Man
A pac-man inspired game on p5js, not a replica of the original.

The green enemy tracks you but can be thrown off course, the red enemies patrol randomly.
The yellow orb you control can be moved around inside the cell because I wanted the game to run at 60FPS and this didnt allow for the keyboard stroke to confidently register a change in
direction. There are a few fixes to this but it is something I should have anticipated at the start and not blundered into at the end.
